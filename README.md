**OpenSoundGrid** is a native Linux audio matrix mixer. It gives streamers, podcasters, and musicians the same per-source, per-mix volume control that Wave Link and GoXLR software provide on other platforms — built on PulseAudio today, with PipeWire native support on the roadmap.

## Why OpenSoundGrid

Linux has no Wave Link equivalent. Every tool that exists is either too technical for non-engineers or too limited for real production use.

- **PulseAudio module-loopback routing** requires manual `pactl` commands and breaks on daemon restart. OpenSoundGrid manages it automatically.
- **pavucontrol** shows streams but has no matrix, no per-destination volumes, and no persistent routing. OpenSoundGrid persists everything across sessions.
- **JACK** is powerful but requires a complete audio stack replacement and deep technical knowledge. OpenSoundGrid works on top of your existing PulseAudio setup.
- **Existing mixers target hardware** — GoXLR, Rodecaster, Wave Link all require proprietary hardware. OpenSoundGrid is software-only.
- **No app routing** — nothing on Linux lets you send specific applications to specific mixes (e.g., Discord to Monitor only, game audio to Stream + Monitor). OpenSoundGrid does this with a single pick list.

OpenSoundGrid fixes all of this with a single native binary, zero daemon changes, and a purpose-built matrix UI.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moabualruz/open-sound-grid.git
cd open-sound-grid
cargo run
```

PulseAudio must be running. The app auto-discovers hardware inputs/outputs and running audio applications on startup.

```bash
# Run with full debug tracing
RUST_LOG=open_sound_grid=debug cargo run

# Run with trace-level (very verbose)
RUST_LOG=open_sound_grid=trace cargo run
```

## Installation

### From Source (Rust)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moabualruz/open-sound-grid.git
cd open-sound-grid
cargo build --release
./target/release/open-sound-grid
```

### AUR (Arch Linux)

```bash
yay -S open-sound-grid
# or
paru -S open-sound-grid
```

### System Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| Rust | 1.85+ (edition 2024) |
| PulseAudio | 15+ |
| Linux | Any desktop distribution |

## How It Works

OpenSoundGrid models audio as a **matrix**: sources on the left, mixes across the top. Every intersection is an independent volume control backed by a PulseAudio `module-loopback` instance.

    null sinks       loopback modules
   (channels)        (matrix cells)
```

**Channels** are PulseAudio null sinks. Applications are routed to a channel by moving their stream. **Mixes** are output destinations — each backed by a set of module-loopbacks, one per active channel. Enabling a cell in the matrix creates (or activates) the corresponding loopback; adjusting its volume sets the loopback latency-corrected volume.

Configuration is persisted to TOML via `confy` and restored on next launch. No PulseAudio config files are modified.

## Architecture

```
src/
  app.rs           — iced Application: Message enum, update(), view(), subscriptions
  main.rs          — entry point: single-instance guard, plugin init, tray, iced startup
  config.rs        — TOML persistence via confy (~/.config/open-sound-grid/)
  resolve.rs       — freedesktop app name/icon resolution from desktop entries
  tray.rs          — system tray via ksni (StatusNotifierItem / SNI protocol)
  error.rs         — thiserror error types
  lib.rs           — crate root, module declarations
  engine/
    mod.rs         — MixerEngine: command sender, connection state, plugin bridge
    state.rs       — MixerState: UI-facing mirror of plugin state (channels, mixes, routes)
  plugin/
    mod.rs         — AudioPlugin trait definition, capabilities, plugin info
    api.rs         — PluginCommand / PluginResponse / PluginEvent protocol (no shared state)
    manager.rs     — event-driven plugin thread, unified command/event channel
  plugins/
    pulseaudio/
      mod.rs       — PulseAudio backend: channel/mix lifecycle, loopback routing
      connection.rs— PA mainloop connection wrapper
      apps.rs      — running application stream discovery and routing
      devices.rs   — hardware sink/source enumeration, output device selection
      modules.rs   — null sink and loopback module management
      peaks.rs     — pactl subscribe listener for real-time peak level events
  ui/
    matrix.rs      — matrix grid widget: the core routing surface
    sidebar.rs     — collapsible hardware input sidebar
    app_list.rs    — detected application routing panel
    audio_slider.rs— volume slider with dB readout
    vu_meter.rs    — horizontal VU meter bar (driven by peak level events)
    eq_widget.rs   — parametric EQ canvas: biquad curve, band handles, spectrum overlay
    theme.rs       — design tokens (colors, spacing)
    mod.rs         — UI module root
```

**Key design decisions:**

- **Unified channel architecture** — channels and mixes are both first-class objects in `MixerState`. Every route cell (channel × mix) carries its own volume and mute state. Add or remove channels/mixes at runtime; the matrix redraws and PA state updates atomically.
- **No shared state between plugin and UI** — all communication flows through typed `PluginCommand` / `PluginEvent` messages over async channels. The UI never touches plugin internals directly.
- **Event-driven plugin thread** — the PA backend runs a dedicated event loop using `pactl subscribe` for real-time change notifications. There is no polling loop; events wake the thread only when PA signals a change. The thread owns the PA mainloop connection for its lifetime.
- **Zero-latency event subscription** — plugin events arrive through an `iced::Subscription` stream, not polling. Peak level updates drive VU meters at ~20ms intervals without blocking the UI thread.
- **Full libpulse introspect migration** — all module load/unload, volume control, mute, stream move, and device enumeration operations use the native libpulse introspect API. No `pactl` shell-outs remain in the audio path.
- **PeakMonitor rewrite** — `peaks.rs` uses `SharedPeak` atomics: a background thread writes raw peak values and the UI reads them lock-free on each frame tick. PA PEAK_DETECT stream infrastructure is in place; callback wiring is the remaining step for v0.4.
- **Device failover** — config carries a ranked backup device list per mix. On startup and on device disappearance the engine walks the list and activates the first available sink.
- **Parametric EQ canvas** — `ui/eq_widget.rs` renders a biquad frequency-response curve on a canvas widget. Drag band handles to tune frequency, gain, and Q; the curve updates in real time.
- **Spectrum analyzer overlay** — simulated FFT display rendered as an overlay on the EQ canvas. Real FFT from PA audio streams is planned for v0.4.
- **Linked sliders** — proportional scaling mode: moving one channel's fader scales all linked channels relative to each other rather than setting an absolute value.
- **Plugin trait abstraction** — the `AudioPlugin` trait decouples the UI from PulseAudio. A PipeWire backend can be added without touching the matrix, engine, or UI code.
- **Single binary** — no daemon, no background service. The app owns its PulseAudio connection for its lifetime.

## Configuration

OpenSoundGrid stores its config at `~/.config/open-sound-grid/default-config.toml` (managed by `confy`). The file is created on first launch and auto-saved whenever channels, mixes, or UI state change.

```toml
[[channels]]
name = "Music"

[[channels]]
name = "Game"

[[channels]]
name = "Voice"

[[channels]]
name = "System"

[[mixes]]
name = "Monitor"
icon = "🎧"
color = [100, 149, 237]
output_device = "alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo"

[[mixes]]
name = "Stream"
icon = "📡"
color = [255, 99, 71]
output_device = ""

[audio]
latency_ms = 20
output_device = "auto"

[ui]
compact_mode = false
window_width = 1000
window_height = 600
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `channels[].name` | Display name for the channel (null sink) | — |
| `mixes[].name` | Display name for the output mix | — |
| `mixes[].icon` | Emoji or single character shown in the mix header | `""` |
| `mixes[].color` | RGB accent color `[r, g, b]` | `[128, 128, 128]` |
| `mixes[].output_device` | PulseAudio sink name for this mix; omit or `""` for auto | `null` (auto) |
| `audio.latency_ms` | Loopback latency in milliseconds | `20` |
| `audio.output_device` | Default fallback output device | `"auto"` |
| `ui.window_width` / `ui.window_height` | Window dimensions | `1000 x 600` |
| `ui.compact_mode` | Compact layout toggle | `false` |

To reset to defaults, delete the config file and relaunch:

```bash
rm ~/.config/open-sound-grid/default-config.toml
```

## Tests

```bash
cargo test           # 53 unit tests
cargo clippy         # zero warnings
```

Tests cover config serialization/deserialization, default values, channel/mix lifecycle, route state mutations, and PA module name parsing. PulseAudio does not need to be running to execute the unit test suite.

## Known Limitations (v0.3)

- **VU meters show volume-based levels, not true signal amplitude.** PA PEAK_DETECT
  stream infrastructure is in place and SharedPeak atomics are wired up; the remaining
  work is connecting the PA stream callback to populate those values. Planned for v0.4.
- **Effects chain does not process audio inline.** The parameter UI, fundsp graph
  structure, and storage all work, but audio is not yet captured and reinjected through
  the effects graph. Inline processing via PA stream capture/reinject is planned for v0.4.
- **Spectrum analyzer display is simulated.** The overlay renders a plausible curve but
  does not reflect real FFT data from PA audio streams. Real FFT is planned for v0.4.
- **Light theme partially applied.** Custom widget styles use theme-aware colors but
  some iced default widgets may not fully match the warm palette.

## Contributing

```bash
cargo check                    # Type-check without building
cargo build                    # Debug build
cargo test                     # Run all unit tests (no PA required)
cargo fmt --all                # Format (required before commit)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings    # Lint (must pass clean)
```

PulseAudio must be running for integration and end-to-end testing. The unit test suite runs without PA. Set `RUST_LOG` for verbose tracing output when debugging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=open_sound_grid=debug cargo run
RUST_LOG=open_sound_grid=trace cargo run
```

All changes go through a pull request. Follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, etc.
